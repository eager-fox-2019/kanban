        Kanban (看板) (signboard or billboard in Japanese) is a scheduling system for lean
        manufacturing and just-in-time manufacturing (JIT).
        Taiichi Ohno, an industrial engineer at Toyota,
        developed kanban to improve manufacturing efficiency.
        Kanban is one method to achieve JIT.
        The system takes its name from the cards that track production within a factory.
        For many in the automotive sector, kanban is known
        as the "Toyota nameplate system" and as such
        the term is not used by some other automakers.
